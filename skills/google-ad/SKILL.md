# Google Ad — Creating Google Ads campaign...
*Designs search and display campaigns with keyword groups, bidding strategy, responsive search ads, ad extensions, and Quality Score optimization for Google Ads.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "Google ad", "search ad", "PPC", "Google Ads" | ACTIVE |
| User says "responsive search ad" or "ad extensions" | ACTIVE |
| User wants to run paid search or display campaigns | ACTIVE |
| User wants Facebook/Meta/Instagram ads | DORMANT — use Facebook Ad |
| User wants organic SEO ranking | DORMANT — use SEO skills |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Bid on your brand name? That's free in organic" | Competitors bid on your brand. Brand campaigns have 5-10x ROAS and protect your traffic. |
| "Use broad match for everything" | Broad match burns budget on irrelevant queries. Start with phrase and exact match. |
| "One ad group, all keywords" | Keyword-to-ad relevance drives Quality Score. Group tightly themed keywords (5-15 per ad group). |
| "Set it and forget it" | Check search term reports weekly. Negative keywords save 20-30% of wasted spend. |
| "More keywords = more traffic" | 10-20 high-intent keywords outperform 200 broad keywords every time. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Campaign Requirements

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Product/service** — what are you advertising? (name, URL, price point)
> 2. **Campaign type** — Search, Display, Shopping, or Performance Max?
> 3. **Target location** — countries, states, cities, or radius?
> 4. **Monthly budget** — total ad spend available?
> 5. **Goal** — sales, leads, phone calls, or website traffic?
> 6. **Competitors** — who else bids on these terms?

### Step 2: Keyword Research & Grouping

**Keyword intent tiers:**

| Tier | Intent | Match Type | Example | Priority |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Tier 1 | Bottom-funnel (buy now) | Exact | [buy crm software] | Highest |
| Tier 2 | High-intent (solution-aware) | Exact/Phrase | "best crm for small business" | High |
| Tier 3 | Mid-intent (problem-aware) | Phrase | "how to manage customer data" | Medium |
| Tier 4 | Brand terms | Exact | [your brand name] | Always on |

**Ad group structure (SKAG-inspired):**

```
Campaign: [Product/Service] — Search
├── Ad Group 1: [Core keyword theme A]
│   ├── Keywords (5-15): [exact] and "phrase" match variations
│   ├── Responsive Search Ad 1
│   └── Responsive Search Ad 2
├── Ad Group 2: [Core keyword theme B]
│   ├── Keywords (5-15): [exact] and "phrase" match variations
│   ├── Responsive Search Ad 1
│   └── Responsive Search Ad 2
├── Ad Group 3: [Brand terms]
│   ├── Keywords: [brand name], [brand + product]
│   └── Responsive Search Ad (brand-specific)
└── Ad Group 4: [Competitor terms]
    ├── Keywords: [competitor name + alternative]
    └── Responsive Search Ad (comparison angle)
```

**Negative keyword starter list:**

| Category | Negative Keywords |
|----------|------------------|
| Free-seekers | free, cheap, discount, coupon, torrent, crack |
| Job-seekers | jobs, careers, hiring, salary, interview |
| Education | tutorial, course, how to, what is, definition |
| Irrelevant | review, complaint, lawsuit, scam |

Customize negatives based on the specific business.

### Step 3: Write Responsive Search Ads (RSA)

Each RSA requires up to 15 headlines (30 chars each) and 4 descriptions (90 chars each). Google rotates and tests combinations automatically.

**Headline categories (provide at least 3 from each):**

| Category | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Keyword match | Relevance to search query | "CRM Software for Small Teams" |
| Benefit-driven | Why they should care | "Close 3x More Deals" |
| Feature-specific | What's included | "Built-In Email & Pipeline" |
| Social proof | Trust signals | "Trusted by 10,000+ Companies" |
| Urgency/offer | Drive immediate action | "Start Free — No Card Required" |

**RSA template:**

```
Headlines (15):
H1: [Primary keyword + core benefit]              ← pin to position 1
H2: [Secondary benefit or feature]                  ← pin to position 2
H3: [Social proof — customer count or rating]
H4: [Offer — free trial, discount, or guarantee]    ← pin to position 3
H5: [Feature 1]
H6: [Feature 2]
H7: [Feature 3]
H8: [Urgency — limited time or scarcity]
H9: [Question — "Need [solution]?"]
H10: [Brand name + value proposition]
H11: [Competitor comparison angle]
H12: [Outcome — "Get [result] in [timeframe]"]
H13: [Trust — "Award-Winning" or "Top Rated"]
H14: [Location-specific if relevant]
H15: [Alternative phrasing of H1]

Descriptions (4):
D1: [Expand on the core value prop. Include a CTA. 90 chars max.]  ← pin to position 1
D2: [List 2-3 features with benefits. 90 chars max.]
D3: [Social proof + trust signal. 90 chars max.]
D4: [Offer details + urgency + CTA. 90 chars max.]                  ← pin to position 2
```

**Pinning strategy:**
- Pin your best keyword-match headline to position 1 (guarantees relevance)
- Pin your best CTA description to position 1
- Leave all others unpinned so Google can optimize combinations
- Never pin more than 3 elements — over-pinning kills Google's ability to test

### Step 4: Configure Ad Extensions

Ad extensions increase ad real estate and improve CTR by 10-15%.

| Extension | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Sitelinks** (4-6) | Direct links to key pages | "Pricing", "Features", "Case Studies", "Free Trial" |
| **Callouts** (4-6) | Highlight benefits | "24/7 Support", "No Setup Fee", "Free Migration" |
| **Structured snippets** | List features/categories | Types: "Features: Pipeline, Automation, Reports, API" |
| **Call extension** | Show phone number | Business phone for call-heavy businesses |
| **Price extension** | Show pricing | Plan names with starting prices |
| **Image extension** | Add product images | Product screenshot or logo |
| **Lead form** | Capture leads in-SERP | For lead gen campaigns |

**Sitelink template:**

```
Sitelink 1: [Page Name]
  - Description 1: [Benefit or detail, 35 chars]
  - Description 2: [Supporting detail, 35 chars]
  - URL: [landing page URL]
```

### Step 5: Quality Score Optimization

Quality Score (1-10) directly affects CPC and ad position. Three factors:

| Factor | Weight | How to Improve |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Expected CTR** | ~40% | Write compelling headlines, use ad extensions, test RSA variations |
| **Ad relevance** | ~25% | Match ad copy to keyword intent — keyword in headline + description |
| **Landing page experience** | ~35% | Fast load (<3s), mobile-friendly, keyword on page, clear CTA, relevant content |

**Quality Score action plan:**

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 7-10 | Performing well. Monitor and maintain. |
| 5-6 | Review ad relevance — tighten keyword-to-ad matching. Improve landing page. |
| 3-4 | Rewrite ads. Consider splitting ad group into tighter themes. Audit landing page. |
| 1-2 | Pause keyword. The intent mismatch is too large to fix with copy alone. |

### Step 6: Bidding Strategy & Budget

**Bidding strategy selection:**

| Strategy | When to Use | Minimum Data |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Manual CPC | Starting out, want full control | None |
| Maximize clicks | Early testing, building data | None |
| Target CPA | Steady conversion volume | 30+ conversions/month |
| Target ROAS | E-commerce with variable order values | 50+ conversions/month |
| Maximize conversions | Budget-constrained, want volume | 15+ conversions/month |

**Budget allocation:**

| Campaign Type | Budget % | Reasoning |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Brand terms | 10-15% | Low CPC, high conversion, defensive |
| High-intent non-brand | 50-60% | Primary revenue driver |
| Mid-intent | 20-25% | Pipeline building |
| Competitor terms | 5-10% | Offensive, higher CPC expected |

**Daily budget calculation:**
- Monthly budget ÷ 30.4 = daily budget
- Allocate per campaign based on percentages above
- Google may spend up to 2x daily budget on high-traffic days (averages over month)

### Step 7: Launch Checklist & Optimization Schedule

**Pre-launch checklist:**
- [ ] Conversion tracking verified (test conversion fires correctly)
- [ ] Google Tag installed on all landing pages
- [ ] Negative keyword list applied
- [ ] Ad extensions configured (minimum: sitelinks + callouts)
- [ ] Landing pages load <3 seconds (test on mobile)
- [ ] Geotargeting set correctly
- [ ] Ad schedule matches business hours (if applicable)
- [ ] Budget and bidding strategy configured

**Optimization schedule:**

| Frequency | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Daily (first week) | Check spend pacing, pause any obvious waste |
| Weekly | Review search terms report, add negatives, check Quality Scores |
| Bi-weekly | Analyze RSA asset performance, replace "Low" rated headlines/descriptions |
| Monthly | Review campaign-level metrics, reallocate budget to top performers |
| Quarterly | Full account audit — structure, keywords, landing pages, competitor landscape |
