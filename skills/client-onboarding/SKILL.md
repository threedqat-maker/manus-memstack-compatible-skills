# Client Onboarding — Setting up new client...
*Produces a complete client onboarding package with welcome email, intake questionnaire, kickoff meeting agenda, access provisioning checklist, expectations document, and 30/60/90-day check-in schedule.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "client onboarding", "new client", "onboard client" | ACTIVE |
| User says "kickoff meeting", "intake form", "welcome email" | ACTIVE |
| User just signed a new client and needs to set up the engagement | ACTIVE |
| User wants a contract or agreement | DORMANT — use Contract Template |
| User wants to send an invoice | DORMANT — use Invoice Generator |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Start working immediately" | Without intake and alignment, you'll waste the first 2 weeks on rework. |
| "Skip the expectations document" | Unclear expectations cause 80% of client conflicts. Document everything upfront. |
| "No single point of contact" | Multiple client contacts = conflicting feedback. Designate one decision-maker. |
| "Forget access provisioning" | Waiting for logins and credentials delays the project by days or weeks. |
| "No check-in schedule" | Without scheduled touchpoints, small issues become big surprises. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Client Information

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Client** — company name, primary contact, industry
> 2. **Project** — what was sold? (service type, scope, deliverables)
> 3. **Timeline** — start date, key milestones, end date
> 4. **Communication** — preferred channel (email, Slack, calls)?
> 5. **Access needed** — what systems, accounts, or assets do you need from them?

### Step 2: Send Welcome Email

**Welcome email template:**

```
Subject: Welcome aboard! Here's what happens next — [Your Company]

Hi [Client Name],

Welcome to [Your Company]! We're excited to work with you on [Project Name].

Here's what to expect in the next few days:

1. **Intake questionnaire** (attached / linked below) — please complete
   by [date, 2-3 business days]. This helps us understand your goals,
   preferences, and current setup.

2. **Access provisioning** — we'll need a few logins and assets from you
   (details in the questionnaire). The sooner we have access, the sooner
   we can start.

3. **Kickoff call** — I've sent a calendar invite for [date/time].
   This is a [30/60]-minute call where we align on goals, timeline, and
   communication cadence.

Your primary point of contact is [Name] ([email]). For anything urgent,
you can also reach us at [phone/Slack].

If you have any questions before the kickoff, just reply to this email.

Looking forward to getting started!

[Your Name]
[Title]
