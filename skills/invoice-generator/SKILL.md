# Invoice Generator — Creating professional invoice...
*Generates professional invoices with line items, tax calculations, payment terms, due dates, and payment instructions — output as structured markdown ready for PDF conversion.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "invoice", "generate invoice", "create invoice", "bill client" | ACTIVE |
| User says "line items" or "payment terms" | ACTIVE |
| User needs a professional invoice for a client | ACTIVE |
| User wants a contract or service agreement | DORMANT — use Contract Template |
| User wants financial projections | DORMANT — use Financial Model |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "No invoice number" | Sequential invoice numbers are required for accounting and tax compliance. |
| "Vague line items" | "Consulting — $5,000" invites disputes. Itemize by deliverable, hours, or phase. |
| "No payment terms" | Without explicit terms (Net 30, due on receipt), clients have no obligation to pay on time. |
| "Skip tax line" | Even if tax is $0, show the tax line. It demonstrates professionalism and compliance. |
| "No late payment terms" | Without stated consequences, you have no leverage on overdue invoices. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Invoice Details

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Client** — company name, contact person, billing address
> 2. **Your business** — business name, address, tax ID / EIN (if applicable)
> 3. **Line items** — what are you billing for? (description, quantity, rate)
> 4. **Payment terms** — Net 30, Net 15, due on receipt?
> 5. **Tax** — applicable tax rate? (state sales tax, VAT, or exempt)
> 6. **Currency** — USD, EUR, GBP, etc.?

### Step 2: Generate Invoice Number

**Invoice numbering convention:**

```
[PREFIX]-[YEAR][MONTH]-[SEQUENCE]
Example: INV-202603-001
```

| Component | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Prefix | `INV` (standard), `PRO` (proforma), `CR` (credit note) |
| Date | YYYYMM of invoice date |
| Sequence | 001, 002, 003... (reset yearly or continuous) |

**Alternative formats:**
- Client-based: `INV-ACME-001`
- Project-based: `INV-PROJ042-001`

### Step 3: Build Line Items

**Line item table:**

| # | Description | Qty | Unit | Rate | Amount |
|---|------------|-----|------|------|--------|
| 1 | [Detailed description of work/deliverable] | [X] | [hours/units/flat] | $[X.XX] | $[X.XX] |
| 2 | [Detailed description] | [X] | [unit] | $[X.XX] | $[X.XX] |
| 3 | [Detailed description] | [X] | [unit] | $[X.XX] | $[X.XX] |

**Line item rules:**
- Each line should describe a specific deliverable or time period
- Include enough detail to prevent client questions ("Website development" → "Homepage redesign — responsive layout, 3 revision rounds")
- For hourly work: include date range and total hours
- For project work: reference the SOW or contract phase
- For expenses: mark as "Reimbursable expense" with receipt reference

**Totals calculation:**

```
Subtotal:                    $[sum of line amounts]
Discount ([X]%):            -$[discount amount]
Subtotal after discount:     $[adjusted subtotal]
Tax ([X]% [tax name]):      +$[tax amount]
──────────────────────────────────
Total Due:                   $[final total]
```

### Step 4: Set Payment Terms

**Standard payment terms:**

| Term | Meaning | Best For |
|------|---------|---------|
| Due on receipt | Pay immediately | Small amounts, first-time clients |
| Net 15 | Due within 15 days | Freelance, small projects |
| Net 30 | Due within 30 days | Standard business term |
| Net 60 | Due within 60 days | Enterprise, government |
| 50/50 | 50% upfront, 50% on completion | Projects >$5,000 |
| Milestone | Payment at each project phase | Large projects |

**Late payment clause:**

```
Late Payment: Invoices not paid within [X] days of the due date will
incur a late fee of [1.5]% per month ([18]% annually) on the outstanding
balance. All collection costs, including attorney fees, will be the
responsibility of the client.
```

**Early payment discount (optional):**

```
2/10 Net 30: 2% discount if paid within 10 days; full amount due in 30 days.
```

### Step 5: Add Payment Instructions

```markdown
## Payment Methods

**Bank Transfer (preferred):**
Bank: [Bank name]
Account name: [Business name]
Routing number: [XXXXXXXXX]
Account number: [XXXXXXXXX]
Reference: [Invoice number]

**Online Payment:**
Pay online: [Payment link — Stripe, PayPal, or Square invoice URL]

**Check:**
Make payable to: [Business name]
Mail to: [Mailing address]
Memo: [Invoice number]

**Wire Transfer (international):**
SWIFT/BIC: [Code]
IBAN: [Number]
Bank address: [Address]
```

### Step 6: Assemble the Invoice

**Invoice template:**

```markdown
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                        INVOICE

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**From:**                          **Invoice #:** [INV-YYYYMM-NNN]
[Your Business Name]               **Date:** [Invoice date]
[Your Address]                      **Due Date:** [Due date]
[City, State ZIP]                   **Terms:** [Net 30 / etc.]
[Email]
[Phone]
[Tax ID: XX-XXXXXXX]

**Bill To:**
[Client Company Name]
[Client Contact Name]
[Client Address]
[City, State ZIP]
[Client Email]

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

| #  | Description                     | Qty  | Rate      | Amount    |
|----|---------------------------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1  | [Line item description]         | [X]  | $[X.XX]   | $[X.XX]   |
| 2  | [Line item description]         | [X]  | $[X.XX]   | $[X.XX]   |
| 3  | [Line item description]         | [X]  | $[X.XX]   | $[X.XX]   |

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                              Subtotal:      $[X,XXX.XX]
                              Tax ([X]%):    $[XXX.XX]
                              ──────────────────────────
                              **TOTAL DUE:   $[X,XXX.XX]**
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Payment Instructions
[From Step 5]

## Terms
- Payment is due within [X] days of invoice date.
- [Late payment clause from Step 4]
- [Early payment discount if applicable]

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thank you for your business.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Step 7: Recurring Invoice Setup

For ongoing retainer or subscription billing:

```markdown
## Recurring Invoice Schedule

| Invoice # | Period | Amount | Due Date | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| INV-202601-001 | Jan 2026 | $[X] | [Date] | Paid |
| INV-202602-001 | Feb 2026 | $[X] | [Date] | Paid |
| INV-202603-001 | Mar 2026 | $[X] | [Date] | Current |
| INV-202604-001 | Apr 2026 | $[X] | [Date] | Upcoming |
```

**Automation tips:**
- Use Stripe Invoicing, QuickBooks, or FreshBooks for recurring invoices
- Set automatic payment reminders: 3 days before due, on due date, 7 days overdue
- Auto-generate the next invoice on a fixed schedule (1st of month, etc.)

## Output Format

Deliver the complete invoice in the template format from Step 6, ready to be:
- Converted to PDF (via Pandoc, browser print, or invoicing tool)
- Pasted into an invoicing platform
- Sent directly to the client
