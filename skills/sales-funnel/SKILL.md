# Sales Funnel — Mapping customer journey from stranger to buyer...
*Maps the complete customer journey across TOFU/MOFU/BOFU stages with page templates, copy hooks, conversion targets, and optimization checklist.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "sales funnel", "funnel", "conversion funnel" | ACTIVE |
| User says "customer journey" or "buyer journey" | ACTIVE |
| User wants to map awareness → conversion → retention flow | ACTIVE |
| User wants ad copy only (no funnel structure) | DORMANT — use Facebook Ad or Google Ad |
| User wants a time-bound launch plan | DORMANT — use Launch Plan |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Start with a sales page" | Strangers don't buy. Build awareness and trust first, then pitch. |
| "One funnel fits all" | B2B, B2C, SaaS, and e-commerce funnels have fundamentally different structures. |
| "Skip the nurture stage" | MOFU is where trust is built. Jumping from ad to checkout kills conversion. |
| "Optimize before traffic" | You need 1,000+ visitors per stage before conversion data is meaningful. |
| "Same message everywhere" | Each stage needs copy matched to the buyer's awareness level. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Funnel Requirements

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Product/service** — what are you selling? (price point, delivery model)
> 2. **Business model** — B2B SaaS, B2C e-commerce, info product, service business?
> 3. **Target audience** — who is the ideal buyer? (demographics, pain points)
> 4. **Current state** — do you have existing traffic, email list, or social following?
> 5. **Primary goal** — lead generation, direct sales, subscription, or booking calls?

### Step 2: Define Funnel Type

Select the funnel architecture based on business model:

| Model | Funnel Type | Key Stages |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **B2C E-commerce** | Product Funnel | Ad → Product Page → Cart → Checkout → Upsell → Follow-up |
| **B2B SaaS** | Free Trial Funnel | Content → Lead Magnet → Email Nurture → Free Trial → Onboarding → Paid |
| **Info Products** | Webinar Funnel | Ad → Registration → Webinar → Offer → Checkout → Delivery |
| **Service Business** | Consultation Funnel | Content → Lead Magnet → Case Study → Application → Call → Close |
| **Subscription** | Value Ladder | Free Content → Low-Ticket → Core Offer → Premium → VIP |

### Step 3: Map TOFU (Top of Funnel) — Awareness

**Goal:** Attract strangers and create awareness. Conversion target: 2-5% to MOFU.

**Traffic sources:**
- Organic: SEO blog posts, YouTube, social media, podcast appearances
- Paid: Facebook/Instagram ads, Google Search ads, YouTube ads
- Referral: Partnerships, affiliates, guest posting

**TOFU page template:**

```
[TOFU Landing Page]
├── Headline: Address the #1 pain point (problem-aware hook)
├── Subheadline: Promise a specific outcome
├── Social proof: "Join 10,000+ [audience type]"
├── Lead magnet offer: Free [resource] that solves an immediate problem
├── Email capture form: Name + Email (minimal friction)
├── Trust signals: Logos, testimonials, media mentions
└── Exit intent popup: Alternative offer or discount
```

**Copy formula — Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS):**
1. **Problem:** "Struggling with [pain point]?"
2. **Agitation:** "Every day you wait, [consequence gets worse]"
3. **Solution:** "Download our free [resource] to [specific outcome]"

**KPIs:** Traffic volume, email opt-in rate (target: 25-40% on dedicated landing pages), cost per lead

### Step 4: Map MOFU (Middle of Funnel) — Consideration

**Goal:** Nurture leads and build trust. Conversion target: 5-15% to BOFU.

**Nurture sequence:**
1. **Email 1 (Day 0):** Deliver lead magnet + quick win
2. **Email 2 (Day 2):** Share a relevant story/case study
3. **Email 3 (Day 4):** Teach a framework (demonstrate expertise)
4. **Email 4 (Day 7):** Address top objection with proof
5. **Email 5 (Day 10):** Soft pitch — introduce the solution

**MOFU content types:**
- Case studies with specific results ("How [Customer] achieved [Result] in [Timeframe]")
- Comparison guides (your solution vs. alternatives)
- Free workshops or mini-courses
- Behind-the-scenes content (builds authenticity)

**MOFU page template:**

```
[Case Study / Social Proof Page]
├── Headline: "[Customer] achieved [specific result]"
├── Before state: The problem they faced
├── Journey: What they tried, why it failed
├── Solution: How your product/service helped
├── Results: Specific metrics (revenue, time saved, growth)
├── Testimonial quote: In their own words
├── CTA: "Ready for similar results? [Next step]"
└── Objection handler: FAQ section addressing top 3-5 concerns
```

**KPIs:** Email open rate (target: 30%+), click-through rate (target: 3-5%), content engagement time

### Step 5: Map BOFU (Bottom of Funnel) — Decision

**Goal:** Convert qualified leads into buyers. Conversion target: 2-10% depending on price point.

**BOFU page template — Sales Page:**

```
[Sales Page Structure]
├── Hero: Headline + subheadline + hero image/video
├── Problem: 3 pain points the audience recognizes
├── Agitation: Cost of inaction (emotional + financial)
├── Solution: Introduce your offer as the bridge
├── Benefits: 5-7 outcome-focused bullet points
├── Features: What's included (with benefit framing)
├── Social proof: 3-5 testimonials, case study snippets
├── Pricing: Tier structure or single offer with value stack
├── Value stack: List everything included with "value" prices
├── Guarantee: Risk reversal (money-back, free trial, etc.)
├── FAQ: Top 5-7 objections answered
├── Urgency: Deadline, limited spots, or bonus expiration
├── Final CTA: Clear action button with benefit-driven text
└── P.S.: Restate the key benefit and deadline
```

**Pricing psychology triggers:**
- Anchoring: Show the "full value" before the actual price
- Decoy: Include a middle tier that makes the top tier look like a deal
- Urgency: "Offer expires [date]" or "Only [X] spots remaining"
- Risk reversal: "30-day money-back guarantee — no questions asked"

**KPIs:** Sales page conversion rate, average order value, cart abandonment rate (target: <70%)

### Step 6: Map Post-Purchase — Retention & Expansion

**Goal:** Maximize lifetime value and generate referrals.

**Post-purchase sequence:**
1. **Immediate:** Order confirmation + onboarding guide
2. **Day 1:** Welcome email + how to get started
3. **Day 3:** Quick win tutorial (ensure first success)
4. **Day 7:** Check-in + ask for feedback
5. **Day 14:** Upsell/cross-sell related product
6. **Day 30:** Request testimonial or review
7. **Day 60:** Referral program invitation

**Retention strategies:**
- Upsell: Higher-tier version of what they bought
- Cross-sell: Complementary product or service
- Referral: "Give $20, get $20" program
- Community: Private group or membership access

**KPIs:** Customer lifetime value (LTV), repeat purchase rate, Net Promoter Score (NPS), referral rate
