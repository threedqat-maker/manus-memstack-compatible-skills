# Feedback Analyzer — Analyzing customer feedback...
*Categorizes, scores, and prioritizes customer feedback from support tickets, reviews, and surveys into actionable reports with feature request rankings, sentiment trends, and action items.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "analyze feedback", "feedback analysis" | ACTIVE |
| User says "what are customers asking for" | ACTIVE |
| User has support tickets, reviews, or survey data to analyze | ACTIVE |
| User wants competitor pricing or market analysis | DORMANT — use Competitor Analysis |
| User wants to write a PRD from scratch | DORMANT — use PRD Writer |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Build what the loudest customer asks for" | Loudest ≠ most valuable. One enterprise client's niche request shouldn't override 500 users' common need. |
| "Count votes to prioritize" | "Most requested" ignores impact and effort. A rarely requested feature might retain your best customers. |
| "Ignore negative reviews" | 1-star reviews reveal real pain. Positive reviews confirm what works — negatives reveal what to fix. |
| "Read feedback literally" | Users describe symptoms, not root causes. "I need an export button" might mean "I can't get data out." |
| "Analyze once, never again" | Feedback is a continuous signal. Batch-analyze monthly or quarterly to spot trends. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Collect Feedback Data

If the user hasn't provided feedback data, ask:

> 1. **Source** — where is the feedback? (support tickets, app reviews, survey responses, social media, sales call notes)
> 2. **Volume** — how much feedback? (helps determine analysis approach)
> 3. **Time range** — what period does this cover?
> 4. **Format** — text dump, CSV, spreadsheet, or screenshot?
> 5. **Product context** — any recent launches, changes, or known issues?

**Supported input formats:**
- Raw text (pasted feedback items)
- CSV/spreadsheet with feedback column
- Support ticket exports (Intercom, Zendesk, Help Scout)
- App store review exports
- Survey responses (Typeform, Google Forms)
- Social media mentions or comments

### Step 2: Categorize Feedback

Classify each piece of feedback into categories:

**Primary categories:**

| Category | Definition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Feature request** | User wants new functionality | "I wish I could export to PDF" |
| **Bug report** | Something is broken or unexpected | "The save button doesn't work on mobile" |
| **UX issue** | Works but confusing or frustrating | "I can never find the settings page" |
| **Performance** | Speed, reliability, or scaling | "The dashboard takes 30 seconds to load" |
| **Praise** | Positive feedback about what works | "Love the new dark mode!" |
| **Churn signal** | Indicates potential or actual churn | "I'm switching to [competitor] because..." |
| **Pricing** | Feedback about cost or value | "Too expensive for what I get" |
| **Support** | About the support experience itself | "Took 3 days to get a response" |

**Categorization output:**

```markdown
## Feedback Categorization

| ID | Feedback (summarized) | Category | Sentiment | Source | Date |
|----|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|------|
| F-001 | [Summarized feedback] | Feature request | Neutral | Support | [Date] |
| F-002 | [Summarized feedback] | Bug report | Negative | App store | [Date] |
| F-003 | [Summarized feedback] | Praise | Positive | Survey | [Date] |
```

### Step 3: Sentiment Analysis

Rate each feedback item and calculate aggregate sentiment:

**Sentiment scale:**

| Score | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| -2 | Very negative | Anger, threats to cancel, profanity, "terrible", "worst" |
| -1 | Negative | Frustration, disappointment, "can't", "doesn't work" |
| 0 | Neutral | Factual request, no emotional language |
| +1 | Positive | Satisfaction, mild praise, "nice", "helpful" |
| +2 | Very positive | Enthusiasm, recommendation, "love", "amazing", "game-changer" |

**Aggregate sentiment dashboard:**

```markdown
## Sentiment Overview

**Overall sentiment score:** [Average across all feedback]
**Distribution:**
- Very positive (): [X]% ([count])
- Positive (): [X]% ([count])
- Neutral (—): [X]% ([count])
- Negative (): [X]% ([count])
- Very negative (): [X]% ([count])

**Sentiment by category:**
| Category | Avg Sentiment | Volume | Trend |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Feature requests | [Score] | [Count] | [↑ ↓ →] |
| Bug reports | [Score] | [Count] | [↑ ↓ →] |
| UX issues | [Score] | [Count] | [↑ ↓ →] |
| Praise | [Score] | [Count] | [↑ ↓ →] |
```

### Step 4: Extract Feature Requests & Themes

Group related feature requests into themes:

```markdown
## Feature Request Themes

### Theme 1: [Theme Name] — [X mentions]
**User need:** [What users actually need, not what they asked for]

| Request | Mentions | Example Quotes |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| [Specific request A] | [X] | "[Direct quote]" |
| [Specific request B] | [X] | "[Direct quote]" |
| [Specific request C] | [X] | "[Direct quote]" |

**Root need:** [The underlying problem these requests share]
**Potential solutions:**
1. [Solution option A — simplest]
2. [Solution option B — most complete]

---

### Theme 2: [Theme Name] — [X mentions]
[Same format]
```

**Theme extraction rules:**
- Merge duplicates — "PDF export", "download as PDF", "save to PDF" = one request
- Look for the root need behind surface requests
- Group by problem, not by proposed solution
- Note the user segment making each request (free vs. paid, new vs. veteran)

### Step 5: Prioritize with RICE Framework

Score each theme or major request:

| Theme | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| [Theme 1] | [X] | [1-3] | [%] | [person-weeks] | [Score] |
| [Theme 2] | [X] | [1-3] | [%] | [person-weeks] | [Score] |
| [Theme 3] | [X] | [1-3] | [%] | [person-weeks] | [Score] |

**RICE scoring:**

```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort
```

| Factor | How to Score |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reach** | How many users per quarter? (estimated or from feedback volume) |
| **Impact** | 3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low, 0.25 = minimal |
| **Confidence** | 100% = high (data-backed), 80% = medium, 50% = low (gut feel) |
| **Effort** | Person-weeks to build (smaller = better score) |

**Priority buckets (after scoring):**

| Priority | RICE Range | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| P0 — Do now | Top 20% of scores | Schedule for next sprint/quarter |
| P1 — Plan | Middle 40% | Add to roadmap for next quarter |
| P2 — Consider | Lower 30% | Keep in backlog, monitor volume |
| P3 — Decline | Bottom 10% | Close with explanation, revisit if volume grows |

### Step 6: Identify Churn Signals

Flag feedback that indicates churn risk:

```markdown
## Churn Risk Signals

| Signal | Severity | Count | Example |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| Mentions competitor by name | High | [X] | "[Quote]" |
| "Canceling" or "switching" | High | [X] | "[Quote]" |
| Pricing complaints from paying users | Medium | [X] | "[Quote]" |
| Repeated bug reports (same user, same issue) | Medium | [X] | "[Quote]" |
| Feature request marked as "blocker" | Medium | [X] | "[Quote]" |
| Declining usage mentioned | Low | [X] | "[Quote]" |

### Churn prevention recommendations:
1. **Immediate:** [Action for high-severity signals]
2. **This quarter:** [Action for medium-severity patterns]
3. **Ongoing:** [Monitoring approach for low-severity]
```

### Step 7: Generate Action Items

```markdown
## Action Items

### Immediate (this sprint)
| # | Action | Owner | Source |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | [Fix critical bug X] | Engineering | [F-002, F-015] |
| 2 | [Respond to churn risk Y] | Support | [F-008] |

### This Quarter
| # | Action | Owner | Source |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 3 | [Build top RICE-scored feature] | Product + Eng | [Theme 1] |
| 4 | [Address UX issue pattern] | Design + Eng | [Theme 3] |

### Process Improvements
| # | Action | Owner | Source |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 5 | [Set up feedback tagging in support tool] | Support | — |
| 6 | [Schedule monthly feedback review] | Product | — |

### Communicate Back to Users
| # | Action | Channel |
|---|--------|---------|
| 7 | "We heard you — [feature] is shipping in [timeframe]" | Email / Changelog |
| 8 | "Known issue: [bug] — fix incoming [date]" | Status page |
```
