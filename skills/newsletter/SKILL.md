# Newsletter — Writing email newsletter edition...
*Produces an email newsletter edition with subject line formulas, section structure, personalization, link placement strategy, growth tactics, and engagement optimization.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "newsletter", "email newsletter", "weekly digest" | ACTIVE |
| User says "subscriber growth" or "open rates" | ACTIVE |
| User wants to write a newsletter edition or start a newsletter | ACTIVE |
| User wants a lead magnet with email capture | DORMANT — use Lead Magnet |
| User wants a full content automation pipeline | DORMANT — use Content Pipeline |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Newsletter = company updates" | Nobody cares about your company news. Deliver value: insights, tips, curated content. |
| "Generic subject line" | "[Company] Monthly Newsletter" gets 10% opens. Curiosity-driven subjects get 35%+. |
| "No consistent format" | Readers want predictable value. A consistent structure builds habit and trust. |
| "Too many links" | More than 3-5 links per section dilutes clicks. Feature one primary link prominently. |
| "No growth strategy" | "Build it and they will come" doesn't work. Actively promote every issue. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Newsletter Requirements

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Topic/niche** — what's the newsletter about?
> 2. **Audience** — who reads it? (role, industry, experience level)
> 3. **Frequency** — weekly, biweekly, or monthly?
> 4. **Type** — curated links, original essays, tips, industry news, or mixed?
> 5. **Current state** — new or existing? (subscriber count, open rates)
> 6. **Monetization** — free, paid, or sponsored?

### Step 2: Write the Subject Line

**Subject line formulas:**

| Formula | Template | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Curiosity gap** | [Topic]: The [thing] nobody talks about | "Pricing: The metric nobody tracks" |
| **Numbered value** | [X] [things] to [outcome] this week | "5 tools to ship faster this week" |
| **Question** | Why [common practice] [doesn't work / is wrong]? | "Why your landing page isn't converting?" |
| **Personal** | I [did thing] — here's what happened | "I quit meetings for a month" |
| **Direct value** | How to [outcome] (in [constraint]) | "How to write copy that converts (in 20 min)" |
| **Current event** | [Event/trend]: What it means for [audience] | "GPT-5: What it means for developers" |

**Subject line rules:**
- 6-10 words (40-50 characters) for mobile display
- No ALL CAPS, no spam triggers ("FREE", "ACT NOW", "!!!")
- Preview text (first 90 characters of email) should complement, not repeat the subject
- A/B test 2 subjects per send (most platforms support this)
- Track open rates by subject formula — double down on what works

### Step 3: Design Section Structure

**Newsletter format template:**

```markdown
# [Newsletter Name] — [Edition Title or Number]

## Intro (2-3 sentences)
[Personal note, context for this edition, or a hook that frames the content]

---

## [Section 1: Primary Content] (60% of newsletter)
[Your main value — original insight, deep dive, or featured piece]
[Include one primary CTA link]

---

## [Section 2: Quick Hits / Curated] (25% of newsletter)
### [Item 1 title]
[1-2 sentence summary + link]

### [Item 2 title]
[1-2 sentence summary + link]

### [Item 3 title]
[1-2 sentence summary + link]

---

## [Section 3: Closer] (15% of newsletter)
[Personal sign-off, question for readers, or community highlight]

---

[Footer: Unsubscribe | Forward to a friend | [Social links]]
```

**Section type options (pick 2-4 per edition):**

| Section | Content | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Deep Dive** | Original essay or analysis (500-800 words) | Demonstrate expertise |
| **Quick Hits** | 3-5 curated links with one-line summaries | Deliver breadth of value |
| **Tool/Resource** | Featured tool with your take on it | Practical value |
| **Tip of the Week** | One actionable tactic they can use today | Quick win |
| **Community Spotlight** | Reader question, testimonial, or submission | Build community |
| **Sponsor Section** | Sponsored content (clearly labeled) | Monetization |
| **Poll/Question** | Ask readers something — drives replies | Engagement signal |

### Step 4: Write the Edition

**Intro paragraph rules:**
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Personal and conversational (not corporate)
- Frames why THIS edition matters
- Optional: reference a current event or reader feedback

**Body content rules:**
- Write at an 8th-grade reading level (clear, accessible)
- Use headers, bold, and bullet points for scannability
- One idea per paragraph (3 sentences max)
- Link text should describe the destination ("Read the full case study" not "Click here")
- Primary CTA should appear within the first scroll (above 300 words)

**Personalization techniques:**

| Technique | Implementation | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| First name in subject | "Hey {first_name}, [subject]" | +10-15% open rate |
| Segment by interest | Tag subscribers → send relevant content | +20-30% click rate |
| Reference past behavior | "Since you read about [topic]..." | Higher engagement |
| Reader-submitted content | Feature reader questions or wins | Community loyalty |

### Step 5: Link Placement Strategy

**Link placement hierarchy:**

| Position | Purpose | Click Priority |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Above the fold** (first 100 words) | Primary CTA or featured link | Highest |
| **End of main section** | Deeper reading link | High |
| **Quick hits section** | Curated resource links | Medium |
| **Closer** | Social follow or referral link | Low |

**Rules:**
- 1 primary link per edition (the ONE thing you want them to click)
- 3-5 secondary links maximum (curated content, resources)
- No more than 8 total links (including footer) — too many dilutes clicks
- Use descriptive anchor text, not raw URLs
- Track clicks with UTM parameters: `?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=edition-[N]`

### Step 6: Growth Tactics

**Subscriber acquisition channels:**

| Channel | Tactic | Expected Growth |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Website** | Email capture in header, footer, and exit-intent popup | Steady baseline |
| **Social media** | Share a highlight from each edition with subscribe link | 5-15 subs/post |
| **Twitter/X threads** | End threads with "I go deeper in my newsletter: [link]" | 10-50 subs/thread |
| **Cross-promotion** | Swap recommendations with similar-sized newsletters | 50-200 per swap |
| **Referral program** | "Refer 3 friends → get [bonus]" | 10-20% of new subs |
| **Gated content** | Best content behind email signup (lead magnet) | High conversion |
| **Guest posts** | Write for others, link to newsletter in bio | 20-100 per post |

**Retention metrics to track:**

| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Open rate | >35% | <20% |
| Click rate | >3% | <1% |
| Unsubscribe rate | <0.5% per send | >1% |
| Reply rate | >0.5% | 0% (no engagement) |
| Growth rate (net) | >5% monthly | Negative (losing subs) |

### Step 7: Scheduling & Send Optimization

**Optimal send times:**

| Audience | Best Day | Best Time | Why |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----|
| Business / B2B | Tuesday-Thursday | 9-10 AM local | Morning inbox check |
| Creators / Solo | Tuesday or Saturday | 8-9 AM local | Before the day fills up |
| Developers | Wednesday | 10 AM local | Mid-week engagement peak |
| General / Consumer | Sunday or Tuesday | 9-10 AM local | Weekend reading or fresh week |

**Pre-send checklist:**
- [ ] Subject line is 6-10 words, creates curiosity
- [ ] Preview text complements the subject (not a repeat)
- [ ] All links work (click-test every one)
- [ ] UTM parameters on all links
- [ ] Images have alt text
- [ ] Mobile preview looks good (60%+ open on mobile)
- [ ] Unsubscribe link is visible
- [ ] Spell check passed
- [ ] Send a test email to yourself first
