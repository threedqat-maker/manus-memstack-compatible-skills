# Cron Scheduler — Building scheduled job...
*Builds production-grade scheduled jobs with cron syntax, timezone handling, overlap prevention, health checks, monitoring, alerting, and structured logging.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "cron job", "scheduled task", "run every" | ACTIVE |
| User says "cron expression" or "recurring job" | ACTIVE |
| User needs a time-based scheduled task with monitoring | ACTIVE |
| User wants a visual n8n workflow | DORMANT — use n8n Workflow Builder |
| User wants an event-driven webhook | DORMANT — use Webhook Designer |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "No overlap prevention" | If a job takes 10 min and runs every 5 min, you get concurrent executions corrupting data. |
| "Ignore timezones" | Cron defaults to server timezone. Midnight UTC ≠ midnight local. Always set TZ explicitly. |
| "No monitoring" | Silent job failures are invisible. You won't know it broke until users complain. |
| "Log to stdout only" | Stdout disappears on restart. Use structured logging with persistence. |
| "Run as root" | Principle of least privilege. Run jobs under a dedicated service account. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Job Requirements

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Task** — what does the job do? (sync data, send emails, clean up, generate reports)
> 2. **Schedule** — how often? (every 5 min, hourly, daily at 2 AM, weekly)
> 3. **Duration** — how long does a typical run take?
> 4. **Timezone** — which timezone matters? (UTC, user's local, business hours)
> 5. **Platform** — where does this run? (server crontab, cloud function, Docker, Kubernetes)
> 6. **Failure mode** — what happens if it fails? (retry, alert, skip until next run)

### Step 2: Write the Cron Expression

**Cron syntax (5-field standard):**

```
┌───────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-7, 0 and 7 = Sunday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

**Common schedule reference:**

| Schedule | Expression | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Every minute | `* * * * *` | Testing only — too aggressive for production |
| Every 5 minutes | `*/5 * * * *` | Good for near-real-time sync |
| Every 15 minutes | `*/15 * * * *` | Light polling |
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` | At minute 0 of every hour |
| Every 6 hours | `0 */6 * * *` | 4x daily |
| Daily at 2 AM UTC | `0 2 * * *` | Maintenance window |
| Daily at 9 AM ET | `0 14 * * *` | 14:00 UTC = 9:00 AM ET (EST, adjust for DST) |
| Weekdays at 8 AM | `0 8 * * 1-5` | Monday through Friday |
| Weekly (Sunday midnight) | `0 0 * * 0` | Weekly cleanup |
| Monthly (1st at midnight) | `0 0 1 * *` | Monthly reports |
| Quarterly (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct 1st) | `0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` | Quarterly processing |

**Timezone handling:**

```bash
# System crontab — set TZ per job
CRON_TZ=America/New_York
0 9 * * * /path/to/job.sh    # Runs at 9 AM Eastern (handles DST)

# Or set in the crontab header
TZ=UTC
```

```typescript
// Node.js (node-cron) — explicit timezone
import cron from 'node-cron';

cron.schedule('0 9 * * *', () => {
  runDailyReport();
}, {
  timezone: 'America/New_York'
});
```

### Step 3: Implement Overlap Prevention

**Lock-based approach (recommended):**

```typescript
import { acquireLock, releaseLock } from './lockService';

async function runJob() {
  const lockKey = 'job:daily-report';
  const lockTTL = 3600; // seconds — must exceed max job duration

  const acquired = await acquireLock(lockKey, lockTTL);
  if (!acquired) {
    console.log('Job already running — skipping this execution');
    return;
  }

  try {
    await executeJobLogic();
  } finally {
    await releaseLock(lockKey);
  }
}
```

**Lock implementations by platform:**

| Platform | Lock Method | TTL Support |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Redis | `SET key value NX EX ttl` | Yes |
| PostgreSQL | `pg_advisory_lock(id)` | Session-based |
| File system | `flock` or PID file | Manual cleanup |
| DynamoDB | Conditional put with TTL | Yes |
| Kubernetes | CronJob `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` | Built-in |

**PID file approach (simple servers):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PIDFILE="/tmp/myjob.pid"

if [ -f "$PIDFILE" ] && kill -0 $(cat "$PIDFILE") 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Job already running (PID $(cat $PIDFILE))"
    exit 0
fi

echo $$ > "$PIDFILE"
trap "rm -f $PIDFILE" EXIT

# Job logic here
```

### Step 4: Structured Logging

```typescript
interface JobLog {
  job: string;
  runId: string;        // Unique per execution
  phase: 'start' | 'progress' | 'complete' | 'error';
  timestamp: string;
  durationMs?: number;
  itemsProcessed?: number;
  error?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

function logJob(entry: JobLog): void {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(entry));
}

// Usage
const runId = crypto.randomUUID();
const start = Date.now();

logJob({ job: 'daily-report', runId, phase: 'start', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });

try {
  const result = await executeJobLogic();
  logJob({
    job: 'daily-report', runId, phase: 'complete',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    durationMs: Date.now() - start,
    itemsProcessed: result.count
  });
} catch (error) {
  logJob({
    job: 'daily-report', runId, phase: 'error',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    durationMs: Date.now() - start,
    error: error.message
  });
  throw error;
}
```

### Step 5: Monitoring & Alerting

**Health check pattern — heartbeat:**

```typescript
// After successful job completion, ping a health check URL
async function pingHealthCheck(url: string): Promise<void> {
  await fetch(url); // Services: Cronitor, Healthchecks.io, Better Uptime
}

// The monitoring service alerts if it doesn't receive a ping within the expected window
```

**Alert conditions:**

| Condition | Severity | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Job didn't run (missed heartbeat) | Critical | Page on-call |
| Job failed (error thrown) | High | Slack + email alert |
| Job duration > 2x normal | Warning | Slack notification |
| Job processed 0 items (expected >0) | Warning | Review logs |
| Job overlap detected (lock contention) | Info | Log, investigate if frequent |

**Job history table (for dashboard):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_runs (
  id           SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  job_name     VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  run_id       UUID         NOT NULL,
  status       VARCHAR(20)  NOT NULL, -- 'success' | 'failure' | 'skipped'
  started_at   TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL,
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  duration_ms  INTEGER,
  items_count  INTEGER,
  error        TEXT,
  metadata     JSONB
);

CREATE INDEX idx_job_runs_name_started ON job_runs(job_name, started_at DESC);
```

### Step 6: Production Checklist

**Before deploying:**
- [ ] Cron expression tested with [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)
- [ ] Timezone explicitly set (never rely on server default)
- [ ] Overlap prevention implemented (lock or concurrency policy)
- [ ] Structured logging with run IDs
- [ ] Health check / heartbeat URL configured
- [ ] Alert rules set for: missed run, failure, slow run
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling (finish current item, don't corrupt)
- [ ] Environment variables for all config (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Job runs under dedicated service account (not root)
- [ ] Tested with realistic data volume

**Maintenance:**
- [ ] Review job duration trends monthly (creeping duration = scaling issue)
- [ ] Clean up job history older than 90 days
- [ ] Verify health check alerts with a test failure quarterly
