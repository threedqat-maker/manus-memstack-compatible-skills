# Freelancer Toolkit — Setting up freelancer workflows...
*Produces time tracking sheets, invoice calculations, and project analytics for freelancers managing multiple clients.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

- Do NOT use for proposal writing (that's proposal-writer)
- Do NOT use for scope of work documents (that's scope-of-work)
- Do NOT use for generic invoice templates (that's invoice-generator)
- This skill covers the full freelancer workflow: tracking time → calculating billable → generating invoice → analyzing profitability

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather freelancer context

| Parameter | Default | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Hourly rate | Ask | $150/hr, $85/hr |
| Currency | USD | EUR, GBP, AUD |
| Billing cycle | Monthly | Weekly, per-project |
| Clients | Ask | Acme Corp, StartupX |
| Tax rate | 0% (user adds) | 20% VAT, 25% self-employment |

### Step 2: Time tracking sheet

Create or update a tracking spreadsheet (CSV or markdown):

```markdown
# Time Log — [Month Year]

## [Client Name]

| Date | Project | Task | Hours | Billable | Notes |
|------|---------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| 2026-04-01 | Website Redesign | Homepage wireframes | 3.5 | Yes | Completed v1 |
| 2026-04-01 | Website Redesign | Client feedback call | 0.5 | Yes | Revision notes |
| 2026-04-02 | API Integration | Auth endpoint | 4.0 | Yes | |
| 2026-04-02 | Internal | Admin/invoicing | 1.0 | No | Non-billable |

**Subtotal:** 8.0 billable hours / 9.0 total hours
```

**Time tracking rules:**
1. Log daily — reconstructing from memory loses hours
2. Separate billable from non-billable (admin, learning, invoicing)
3. Round to nearest 15 minutes (0.25 hr increments)
4. Include project and task for accurate per-project reporting
5. Notes field captures context for invoice line items

### Step 3: Invoice calculation

Compute totals from the time log:

```markdown
# Invoice Calculation — [Client Name] — [Period]

| Project | Hours | Rate | Subtotal |
|---------|-------|------|----------|
| Website Redesign | 24.5 | $150 | $3,675.00 |
| API Integration | 16.0 | $150 | $2,400.00 |

| | |
|---|---|
| Subtotal | $6,075.00 |
| Tax ([rate]%) | $[amount] |
| **Total Due** | **$[amount]** |
| Payment terms | Net 30 |
| Due date | [date] |
```

For fixed-price projects, track hours anyway for profitability analysis.

### Step 4: Monthly analytics

Generate a freelancer dashboard:

```markdown
# Freelance Analytics — [Month Year]

## Revenue Summary
| Client | Invoiced | Paid | Outstanding |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| Acme Corp | $6,075 | $6,075 | $0 |
| StartupX | $3,200 | $0 | $3,200 |
| **Total** | **$9,275** | **$6,075** | **$3,200** |

## Time Breakdown
- Total hours logged: 82.0
- Billable hours: 68.5 (83.5% utilization)
- Non-billable hours: 13.5
- Effective hourly rate: $135.40 (revenue / total hours)

## Client Concentration
- Acme Corp: 65.5% of revenue (risk: high dependency)
- StartupX: 34.5%

## Profitability by Project
| Project | Hours | Revenue | Effective Rate |
|---------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Website Redesign | 24.5 | $3,675 | $150/hr |
| API Integration | 16.0 | $2,400 | $150/hr |
| Maintenance | 28.0 | $3,200 | $114/hr |
```

### Step 5: Alerts and recommendations

Flag issues automatically:

| Alert | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Low utilization | < 70% billable | Review non-billable time, reduce admin overhead |
| Client concentration | > 50% one client | Diversify — pursue new leads |
| Outstanding invoices | > 30 days | Send payment reminder |
| Effective rate below target | < 80% of hourly rate | Review scope creep, renegotiate |
| Overwork | > 45 hrs/week sustained | Raise rates or reduce commitments |

### Step 6: File organization

Recommended folder structure:

```
freelance/
  clients/
    acme-corp/
      time-log-2026-04.md
      invoices/
        INV-2026-04-001.md
    startupx/
      time-log-2026-04.md
      invoices/
  analytics/
    2026-04-monthly.md
  templates/
    invoice-template.md
    time-log-template.md
```

## Output Template

```
Freelancer Report — [Period]:
- Billable hours: [N] ([utilization]% utilization)
- Revenue: $[amount] ([N] invoices)
- Outstanding: $[amount]
- Effective rate: $[rate]/hr
- Alerts: [list any flags]

Files updated: [list]
```
