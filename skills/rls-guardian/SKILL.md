# RLS Guardian — Enforcing Row Level Security...
*Enforces Row Level Security on every Supabase table creation, ensuring no table goes live without proper access policies. Provides 4 policy patterns, migration templates, pre-commit checks, and audit queries to find unprotected tables.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User writes CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE SQL | ACTIVE |
| User creates or edits a migration file | ACTIVE |
| User says "new table", "database schema", "add table" | ACTIVE |
| User says "RLS", "row level security", "table policies" | ACTIVE |
| User asks for a general RLS audit of existing tables | DORMANT — use RLS Checker |
| User asks a general SQL query unrelated to schema | DORMANT — do not activate |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Create table now, add RLS later" | Every minute without RLS is a window where all rows are accessible to any authenticated user. RLS must be in the same migration. |
| "Enable RLS but no policies" | `ALTER TABLE ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` with no policies blocks ALL access including the service role via API. Users get empty results, devs panic. |
| "Only add a SELECT policy" | SELECT-only leaves INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE wide open. All 4 operations need explicit policies. |
| "Use `true` as the policy expression" | `USING (true)` makes the table world-readable. Only valid for genuinely public data (e.g. blog posts). Never for user data. |
| "Forget the service role" | Supabase service role bypasses RLS by design. But if you switch to `anon` key on the frontend, every table without policies is exposed. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Classify the Table

Before writing any policy, classify the table's access pattern:

| Pattern | Description | Example Tables |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **User-scoped** | Each row belongs to one user via `user_id` | profiles, settings, api_keys, notifications |
| **Org-scoped** | Rows belong to an organization; users access via membership | projects, invoices, team_settings |
| **Public-read** | Anyone can read, only owners can write | blog_posts, public_profiles, product_listings |
| **Junction** | Many-to-many relationship linking two entities | team_members, project_collaborators |
| **System** | Internal tables not accessed by end users | migrations, cron_jobs, audit_logs |

**Decision tree:**

```
Does the table have a user_id column?
  YES → Does it also have an org/account_id?
    YES → Org-scoped (access via membership check)
    NO  → User-scoped (direct user_id match)
  NO  → Is the data meant to be publicly readable?
    YES → Public-read (open SELECT, restricted writes)
    NO  → Is it a many-to-many join table?
      YES → Junction (inherit access from parent tables)
      NO  → System table (service role only, no RLS policies needed)
```

### Step 2: Write the Migration

Every table migration MUST include 3 parts in this order:
1. `CREATE TABLE` — the schema
2. `ALTER TABLE ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` — the lock
3. `CREATE POLICY` — the keys (all 4 operations)

**Pattern A: User-scoped table**

```sql
-- 1. Create table
CREATE TABLE user_settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  theme TEXT DEFAULT 'dark',
  notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- 2. Enable RLS (MUST be in same migration)
ALTER TABLE user_settings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Policies for all 4 operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own settings"
  ON user_settings FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own settings"
  ON user_settings FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own settings"
  ON user_settings FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own settings"
  ON user_settings FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Pattern B: Org-scoped table**

```sql
-- 1. Create table
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  account_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Policies with membership check
CREATE POLICY "Members can view org projects"
  ON projects FOR SELECT
  USING (
    account_id IN (
      SELECT account_id FROM account_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Members can insert org projects"
  ON projects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    account_id IN (
      SELECT account_id FROM account_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Members can update org projects"
  ON projects FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    account_id IN (
      SELECT account_id FROM account_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    account_id IN (
      SELECT account_id FROM account_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Members can delete org projects"
  ON projects FOR DELETE
  USING (
    account_id IN (
      SELECT account_id FROM account_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Pattern C: Public-read table**

```sql
-- 1. Create table
CREATE TABLE blog_posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  author_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Public read, author-only write
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view published posts"
  ON blog_posts FOR SELECT
  USING (published = true);

CREATE POLICY "Authors can insert own posts"
  ON blog_posts FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

CREATE POLICY "Authors can update own posts"
  ON blog_posts FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = author_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

CREATE POLICY "Authors can delete own posts"
  ON blog_posts FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = author_id);
```

**Pattern D: Junction table**

```sql
-- 1. Create table
CREATE TABLE team_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'member',
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(team_id, user_id)
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE team_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Members can see co-members, only admins can manage
CREATE POLICY "Members can view team roster"
  ON team_members FOR SELECT
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can add team members"
  ON team_members FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can update team members"
  ON team_members FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can remove team members"
  ON team_members FOR DELETE
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

### Step 3: Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing any migration that creates or alters a table, verify:

```markdown
## RLS Guardian Checklist

- [ ] `ALTER TABLE [name] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` present in migration
- [ ] SELECT policy defined
- [ ] INSERT policy defined (with WITH CHECK)
- [ ] UPDATE policy defined (with both USING and WITH CHECK)
- [ ] DELETE policy defined
- [ ] Policy expressions use `auth.uid()` (not `current_setting()` or hardcoded UUIDs)
- [ ] Org-scoped tables use membership subquery (not direct account_id match)
- [ ] No `USING (true)` on non-public tables
- [ ] Policy names are descriptive (not "policy_1", "policy_2")
- [ ] RLS + policies are in the SAME migration file as CREATE TABLE
```

**Critical rule:** If any checkbox fails, do NOT commit. Fix first. A table without RLS in production is a data breach waiting to happen.

### Step 4: Audit Existing Tables

Run this query to find unprotected tables:

```sql
-- Find all public tables without RLS enabled
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND rowsecurity = false
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Find tables with RLS enabled but missing policies:**

```sql
-- Tables with RLS but no policies (locked out — no access at all)
SELECT t.tablename
FROM pg_tables t
LEFT JOIN pg_policies p ON t.tablename = p.tablename
WHERE t.schemaname = 'public'
  AND t.rowsecurity = true
  AND p.policyname IS NULL
ORDER BY t.tablename;
```

**Find tables with incomplete policy coverage:**

```sql
-- Tables missing one or more CRUD policies
SELECT
  t.tablename,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'r' THEN 1 END) AS select_policies,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'a' THEN 1 END) AS insert_policies,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'w' THEN 1 END) AS update_policies,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'd' THEN 1 END) AS delete_policies
FROM pg_tables t
LEFT JOIN pg_policies p ON t.tablename = p.tablename
WHERE t.schemaname = 'public'
  AND t.rowsecurity = true
GROUP BY t.tablename
HAVING
  COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'r' THEN 1 END) = 0
  OR COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'a' THEN 1 END) = 0
  OR COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'w' THEN 1 END) = 0
  OR COUNT(CASE WHEN p.cmd = 'd' THEN 1 END) = 0
ORDER BY t.tablename;
```

### Step 5: Handle Special Cases

**System tables (no user access needed):**

```sql
-- Mark as system table with comment, enable RLS with no policies
-- This blocks ALL access except service role (which bypasses RLS)
ALTER TABLE cron_jobs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
COMMENT ON TABLE cron_jobs IS 'rls:system — service role only, no user access';
```

**Tables with soft-delete:**

```sql
-- Include soft-delete filter in SELECT policy
CREATE POLICY "Users see own non-deleted records"
  ON documents FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND deleted_at IS NULL);
```

**Tables with row-level roles:**

```sql
-- Different access levels within the same table
CREATE POLICY "Owners have full access"
  ON documents FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);

CREATE POLICY "Viewers can only read"
  ON documents FOR SELECT
  USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT document_id FROM document_shares
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND permission = 'view'
    )
  );
```

**ALTER TABLE — adding columns:**

```sql
-- When adding a sensitive column to an existing table,
-- verify existing policies still cover the new data appropriately.
-- No new policies needed unless the column changes access logic.
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN phone TEXT;
-- Existing RLS policies automatically apply to the new column.
-- But if phone should be more restricted, add a column-level grant:
REVOKE ALL ON profiles FROM anon, authenticated;
GRANT SELECT (id, name, avatar_url) ON profiles TO authenticated;
-- Then RLS + column grants together control both row AND column access.
```

## Output Format

When generating a migration that includes a table, output:

```markdown
## Migration: [description]

### Table Classification
| Table | Pattern | Key Column |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| [name] | [user/org/public/junction/system] | [user_id/account_id/etc.] |
