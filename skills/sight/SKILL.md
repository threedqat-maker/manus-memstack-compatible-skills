# ️ Sight — The Hidden Becomes Clear
*Generate Mermaid diagrams showing project architecture, schema, and data flow.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **User asks for a diagram or visualization** | ACTIVE — generate diagram |
| **User says "draw", "diagram", "architecture"** | ACTIVE — generate diagram |
| **User asks to "show" or "map" the structure** | ACTIVE — generate diagram |
| **Discussing diagrams conceptually** | DORMANT — do not activate |
| **User is looking at existing diagrams** | DORMANT — do not activate |

## Protocol

1. **Determine diagram type** from context:
   - "database" / "schema" → `erDiagram`
   - "api" / "endpoints" → `flowchart TD`
   - "components" / "pages" → `graph TD`
   - "architecture" / "structure" → `flowchart TD` (system overview)
   - "flow" / "process" → `sequenceDiagram`

2. **Scan the relevant code:**
   - For DB: read migration files in `database/`
   - For API: list files in `src/app/api/`
   - For pages: list files in `src/app/`
   - For architecture: read package.json, directory structure, configs

3. **Generate Mermaid diagram** as a code block

4. **Optionally save** to `docs/diagrams/{name}.mermaid`

## Inputs
- What to visualize (database, API, components, architecture)
- Project directory

## Outputs
- Mermaid diagram code block ready to render
- Optional saved .mermaid file

## Example Usage

**User:** "draw the AdminStack database schema"

```

​```mermaid
erDiagram
    accounts ||--o{ organizations : "has"
    accounts ||--o{ cc_sessions : "tracks"
    organizations ||--o{ projects : "contains"
    organizations ||--o{ contacts : "stores"
    organizations ||--o{ orders : "processes"

    accounts {
        uuid id PK
        text email
        boolean is_platform_admin
    }
    cc_sessions {
        uuid id PK
        text name
        text status
    }
​```
```
