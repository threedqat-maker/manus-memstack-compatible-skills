#  Echo — Searching the Archives...
*Recall information from past Manus sessions using semantic vector search.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **User says "recall", "remember", "last session", "what did we"** | ACTIVE — search memory | P1 |
| **User asks about past work explicitly ("did we build X?")** | ACTIVE — search memory | P1 |
| **User says "continue from" or "resume" a past topic** | ACTIVE — search memory | P2 |
| **User is describing NEW work to do ("build X", "add Y")** | DORMANT — this is new work, not recall | — |
| **User mentions "memory" in code context (RAM, variables)** | DORMANT — technical term, not MemStack recall | — |
| **User mentions a project name in present tense ("work on X")** | DORMANT — forward-looking, not recall | — |
| **User says "save" or "log" (Diary/Project territory)** | DORMANT — Diary or Project skill handles writing | — |

## Anti-Rationalization

If you're thinking any of these, STOP — you're about to skip the protocol:

| You're thinking... | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I remember this from earlier in the conversation" | You don't persist. Earlier context may be compacted. Run the search. |
| "I can just summarize from what I know" | You know nothing from prior sessions. The database does. Search it. |
| "The user probably doesn't need exact details" | Users ask Echo for specifics — dates, decisions, file paths. Run all steps. |
| "Vector search seems slow, I'll skip to SQLite" | Vector search returns the best results. Always try it first. |
| "I found one result, that's probably enough" | Run ALL steps (vector + SQLite + insights). One source misses context another catches. |
| "The keywords are too vague to search" | Search anyway. Vague queries still return useful semantic matches. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Semantic Vector Search (primary)

Try LanceDB vector search first for best-quality results:
```bash
python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/skills/echo/search.py "<keywords>" --top-k 5
```

If this returns results, present them with scores, dates, and source files.

### Step 2: SQLite Keyword Search (augment or fallback)

Always run SQLite search to supplement vector results or as fallback if Step 1 fails:
```bash
python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" search "<keywords>" --project <project>
```

### Step 3: Recent Sessions and Insights

For additional context:
```bash
python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" get-sessions <project> --limit 5
python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" get-insights <project>
```

### Step 4: Markdown Fallback

If both vector and SQLite return nothing, check `memory/sessions/` and `memory/projects/` for markdown files.

### Step 5: Present Findings

Combine and deduplicate results from all sources:
- **Vector results**: Show with similarity scores and section headings
- **SQLite results**: Show with dates and accomplishment summaries
- **Source attribution**: Always show which source (vector/SQLite/markdown) each result came from
- Date and project name
- What was accomplished
- What was left pending
- Key decisions and insights

### Step 6: No Results

If nothing found across all sources — say clearly: "No session logs found for [topic]. Use Diary to save future sessions."

## Indexing

To re-index sessions after new diary entries (normally done automatically):
```bash
python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/skills/echo/index-sessions.py
```

Use `--force` to re-embed all content (e.g., after changing embedding model):
```bash
python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/skills/echo/index-sessions.py --force
```

## Inputs
- Keywords from the user's prompt (project name, feature name, date range)
- Vector DB: `$MEMSTACK_PATH/memory\vectors\lancedb\` (via LanceDB)
- Database: `$MEMSTACK_PATH/db\memstack.db` (via memstack-db.py)
- Fallback: `$MEMSTACK_PATH/memory\` (legacy markdown files)

## Outputs
- Ranked results with semantic similarity scores
- Source type attribution (vector, database, or markdown fallback)
- Summary of relevant past session context

## Example Usage

**User:** "Do you remember what we did on AdminStack last session?"
