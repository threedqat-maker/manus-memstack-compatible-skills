# n8n Workflow Builder — Designing automation workflow...
*Designs visual n8n workflows with trigger selection, node mapping, data transformations, error handling, and webhook integration.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "n8n workflow", "build a workflow", "automation workflow" | ACTIVE |
| User says "connect services" or wants visual automation | ACTIVE |
| User wants to automate a multi-step process with n8n | ACTIVE |
| User needs a standalone webhook endpoint | DORMANT — use Webhook Designer |
| User needs a cron/scheduled job without n8n | DORMANT — use Cron Scheduler |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "One giant workflow" | Workflows over 20 nodes become unmaintainable. Split into sub-workflows with triggers. |
| "No error handling" | Silent failures mean lost data. Every workflow needs an Error Trigger node. |
| "Hardcoded credentials" | Use n8n's credential store — never paste API keys into HTTP Request nodes. |
| "Skip testing with real data" | Test with production-like payloads. Dummy data hides type mismatches and missing fields. |
| "Poll when you can webhook" | Polling wastes resources. If the service supports webhooks, use the Webhook trigger instead. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Workflow Requirements

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Trigger** — what starts the workflow? (webhook, schedule, app event, manual)
> 2. **Input** — what data comes in? (payload shape, source service)
> 3. **Actions** — what should happen step-by-step?
> 4. **Output** — where does the result go? (database, API, email, Slack, file)
> 5. **Error handling** — what happens if a step fails?
> 6. **Frequency** — how often does this run? (per event, hourly, daily)

### Step 2: Select Trigger Node

| Trigger Type | n8n Node | When to Use |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Incoming webhook** | Webhook | External service sends data to you |
| **Schedule** | Schedule Trigger | Run at fixed intervals (cron) |
| **App event** | [App] Trigger | Slack message, GitHub PR, Stripe payment, etc. |
| **Manual** | Manual Trigger | Testing or on-demand execution |
| **Email** | Email Trigger (IMAP) | React to incoming emails |
| **File change** | Local File Trigger | Watch a directory for new files |
| **Another workflow** | Execute Workflow Trigger | Sub-workflow called by parent |

**Trigger configuration template:**

```
Trigger: [Node name]
Type: [Webhook / Schedule / App event]
Configuration:
  - [Setting 1: e.g., HTTP Method: POST]
  - [Setting 2: e.g., Path: /webhook/orders]
  - [Setting 3: e.g., Authentication: Header Auth]
Output schema:
  {
    "field1": "type — description",
    "field2": "type — description"
  }
```

### Step 3: Map the Workflow Nodes

Design the node sequence from trigger to output:

**Workflow diagram template:**

```
[Trigger] → [Transform/Filter] → [Action 1] → [Action 2] → [Output]
                                       ↓ (on error)
                                  [Error Handler]
```

**Common node patterns:**

| Pattern | Nodes | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Filter & route** | IF / Switch | Route data based on conditions |
| **Transform** | Set / Code / Item Lists | Reshape data between nodes |
| **Batch process** | SplitInBatches → Loop | Process large datasets without timeout |
| **Merge streams** | Merge | Combine data from parallel branches |
| **Lookup & enrich** | HTTP Request → Merge | Add data from external APIs |
| **Deduplicate** | Code (Set-based check) | Prevent processing the same item twice |

**Node specification template (for each node):**

```
Node [N]: [Name]
Type: [n8n node type]
Purpose: [What this node does]
Input: [What it receives from the previous node]
Configuration:
  - [Key setting 1]
  - [Key setting 2]
Output: [What it passes to the next node]
```

### Step 4: Data Transformations

**Accessing data between nodes:**

```javascript
// Reference previous node output
{{ $json.fieldName }}

// Reference a specific node by name
{{ $('Node Name').item.json.fieldName }}

// Access all items from a node
{{ $('Node Name').all() }}

// Current item index in a loop
{{ $itemIndex }}

// Environment variables
{{ $env.MY_VARIABLE }}
```

**Common transformation patterns:**

| Transformation | Node | Expression Example |
|---------------|------|--------------------|
| Rename field | Set | `newName: {{ $json.oldName }}` |
| Format date | Set / Code | `{{ DateTime.fromISO($json.date).toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd') }}` |
| Filter items | IF | `{{ $json.status === 'active' }}` |
| Concatenate | Set | `{{ $json.first + ' ' + $json.last }}` |
| Parse JSON string | Code | `JSON.parse($json.rawBody)` |
| Map array | Code | `items.map(i => ({ json: { id: i.json.id } }))` |
| Aggregate | Code | `[{ json: { total: items.reduce((s,i) => s + i.json.amount, 0) } }]` |

**Code node template (JavaScript):**

```javascript
// Process all items
const results = [];
for (const item of $input.all()) {
  results.push({
    json: {
      id: item.json.id,
      processed: true,
      // Add transformed fields here
    }
  });
}
return results;
```

### Step 5: Error Handling

**Error handling strategy:**

```
[Main Workflow]
  ├── [Error Trigger] → [Log to DB] → [Send Alert]
  └── [Individual nodes with retry]
```

**Three layers of error handling:**

| Layer | Implementation | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Node retry** | Settings → Retry on Fail (max 3, wait 1s) | Transient failures (network, rate limits) |
| **Error Trigger** | Error Trigger node → notification workflow | Catch any unhandled errors |
| **Dead letter** | On error → write to DB/queue for later replay | Don't lose failed items |

**Error Trigger workflow template:**

```
Node 1: Error Trigger
  → Receives: error message, workflow name, node name, execution ID

Node 2: Set (format error)
  → Builds: { workflow, node, error, timestamp, executionUrl }

Node 3: Send alert (Slack / Email / PagerDuty)
  → Message: "Workflow '[name]' failed at node '[node]': [error]"

Node 4: Log to database (optional)
  → Insert error record for tracking and replay
```

### Step 6: Testing & Deployment

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Test with real-shaped data (not just `{ "test": true }`)
- [ ] Test the error path (disable a downstream service and verify error handling fires)
- [ ] Test with empty arrays and null values
- [ ] Test with maximum expected payload size
- [ ] Verify credentials are in n8n credential store (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Check timezone settings on Schedule triggers

**Production deployment:**
- [ ] Set workflow to Active
- [ ] Verify webhook URLs are registered in source services
- [ ] Enable execution logging (Settings → Save Execution Progress)
- [ ] Set execution timeout appropriate for workload
- [ ] Tag workflow with version number and description
- [ ] Document the workflow in your team's runbook
