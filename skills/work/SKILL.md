#  Work — Plan Execution Engaged
*Track tasks, manage plans, and survive CC compacts with three operating modes.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **User says "copy plan", "append plan", "resume plan"** | ACTIVE — use matching mode |
| **User says "what's next", "todo", "priorities"** | ACTIVE — quick query mode |
| **User provides a task list or plan** | ACTIVE — copy mode |
| **General discussion about planning concepts** | DORMANT — do not activate |
| **User is executing a task (not managing the list)** | DORMANT — do not activate |

## Step 0: Silent Context Compilation (MANDATORY)

Before executing ANY mode, silently gather current state. Do NOT present findings. Do NOT ask questions. Just internalize:

1. Read the project's `STATE.md` (if it exists) — current task, blockers, next steps
2. Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` (if it exists) — conventions, architecture decisions
3. Check recent diary:
   ```bash
   python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" get-sessions <project> --limit 3
   ```
4. Check git state:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   git diff --stat
   ```

**This is silent.** Synthesize an internal understanding of where the project stands. Then proceed to the triggered mode with full context. The user already knows their project state — don't waste their time repeating it back.

## Mode 1: Copy Plan

**Trigger:** "copy plan" or when a new plan is provided

1. Parse the entire plan into individual numbered tasks
2. For each task, save to SQLite:
   ```bash
   python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" add-plan-task '{"project":"<name>","task_number":<n>,"description":"<task>","status":"pending"}'
   ```
3. Confirm with task count
4. Also write a markdown copy to `memory/projects/{project}-plan.md` for human readability

**Status values:** `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`

## Mode 2: Append Plan (Update Tasks)

**Trigger:** "append plan" or when updating task statuses

1. Read current plan from SQLite:
   ```bash
   python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" get-plan <project>
   ```
2. Update individual task statuses:
   ```bash
   python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" update-task '{"project":"<name>","task_number":<n>,"status":"completed"}'
   ```
3. Add new tasks if needed via `add-plan-task`
4. No size limits needed — SQLite handles scale

## Mode 3: Resume Plan

**Trigger:** "resume plan" — use after CC compact or new session

1. Load plan from SQLite:
   ```bash
   python "$MEMSTACK_PATH/db/memstack-db.py" get-plan <project>
   ```
2. Parse the JSON output for task statuses
3. Output a summary:
   ```
   Plan: {project} ({done}/{total} complete)

   Completed: [list]
   In Progress: [list]
   Pending: [list]
   Blocked: [list with reasons]

   Recommended next: {first pending task}
   ```
4. Continue from the first incomplete task

## Quick Commands

- **"what's next"** — queries plan, returns the single next pending task
- **"priorities"** — shows top 3 pending items from the plan
- **"todo"** — shows all pending and in-progress items with status

## Inputs
- Plan text (copy mode) or project name (append/resume)
- Database: `$MEMSTACK_PATH/db\memstack.db` (via memstack-db.py)
- Fallback: `$MEMSTACK_PATH/memory\projects\` (legacy markdown)

## Outputs
- Formatted task list with status indicators
- Updated plan file in memory
- Next recommended action

## Example Usage

**User:** "resume plan for AdminStack"

```
