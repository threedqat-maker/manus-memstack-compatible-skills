# Facebook Ad — Creating Meta ad campaign...
*Creates complete ad campaigns with audience targeting, ad copy variations, creative direction, budget allocation, and A/B testing protocol for Meta Ads Manager.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "Facebook ad", "FB ad", "Meta ad", "Instagram ad" | ACTIVE |
| User needs social media ad copy with targeting | ACTIVE |
| User wants to run paid campaigns on Meta platforms | ACTIVE |
| User wants Google Search or Display ads | DORMANT — use Google Ad |
| User wants organic social media content | DORMANT — not an ad skill |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Target everyone" | Broad audiences burn budget. Start narrow (1-5M), expand after finding winners. |
| "One ad, one audience" | Always test 3-5 ad variations per ad set. Meta's algorithm needs options. |
| "Start with $5/day" | Too little for the algorithm to learn. Minimum $20/day per ad set for meaningful data. |
| "Judge ads after 24 hours" | Meta needs 50+ conversions per ad set per week to exit learning phase. Wait 3-7 days. |
| "Use stock photos" | UGC-style creative outperforms polished studio content 2-3x on Meta. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Campaign Requirements

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Product/service** — what are you promoting? (name, price, URL)
> 2. **Objective** — leads, sales, traffic, or brand awareness?
> 3. **Target audience** — who is the ideal customer? (age, interests, pain points)
> 4. **Budget** — daily or monthly ad spend?
> 5. **Existing assets** — do you have customer testimonials, product photos, or video?
> 6. **Previous campaigns** — any past Meta ads data to build on?

### Step 2: Define Campaign Structure

Build the campaign using Meta's three-tier hierarchy:

```
Campaign (1 objective)
├── Ad Set 1: [Audience A] — $[budget]/day
│   ├── Ad 1: [Hook A + Creative A]
│   ├── Ad 2: [Hook B + Creative A]
│   └── Ad 3: [Hook A + Creative B]
├── Ad Set 2: [Audience B] — $[budget]/day
│   ├── Ad 1: [Hook A + Creative A]
│   ├── Ad 2: [Hook B + Creative A]
│   └── Ad 3: [Hook A + Creative B]
└── Ad Set 3: [Lookalike/Retargeting] — $[budget]/day
    ├── Ad 1: [Social proof hook]
    ├── Ad 2: [Urgency hook]
    └── Ad 3: [Testimonial creative]
```

**Campaign objective mapping:**

| Goal | Meta Objective | Optimization Event |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Email signups | Leads | Lead form submission |
| Product sales | Sales | Purchase |
| Website traffic | Traffic | Landing page views |
| App installs | App Promotion | App install |
| Brand awareness | Awareness | Reach or ThruPlay |
| Webinar signups | Leads | Lead form submission |

### Step 3: Build Audience Targeting

**Audience A — Interest-based (cold):**
- Age: [range]
- Gender: [if relevant]
- Location: [countries/regions]
- Interests: [3-5 relevant interests]
- Behaviors: [purchase behavior, device usage]
- Audience size target: 1-5 million

**Audience B — Narrowed interest stack:**
- Must match: [Interest 1] AND [Interest 2]
- Exclude: [competitors' audiences or existing customers]
- Audience size target: 500K-2M

**Audience C — Lookalike:**
- Source: Customer list, website visitors, or video viewers
- Lookalike %: Start at 1% (closest match), test up to 3%
- Country: Same as primary market

**Retargeting audiences (create separately):**
- Website visitors (last 30 days) — exclude purchasers
- Video viewers (75%+ watched) — last 60 days
- Engagement (Instagram/Facebook) — last 90 days
- Cart abandoners — last 14 days

### Step 4: Write Ad Copy Variations

Write 3 copy variations for each hook type:

**Hook Type 1 — Problem-Agitation:**
```
Primary text:
[Problem question that stops the scroll]

[Agitation — what happens if they don't solve it]

[Introduce your solution in 1-2 sentences]

[Key benefit 1]
[Key benefit 2]
[Key benefit 3]

[CTA: Click below to [desired action]]

Headline: [Benefit-driven, 5-8 words]
Description: [Supporting detail or urgency, 20 words max]
CTA button: [Learn More / Shop Now / Sign Up / Get Offer]
```

**Hook Type 2 — Social Proof:**
```
Primary text:
"[Customer testimonial quote — specific result]"

[Bridge: Explain how others are getting the same result]

Here's what you get:
 [Benefit 1]
 [Benefit 2]
 [Benefit 3]

[CTA with urgency or limited offer]

Headline: [Result-focused, 5-8 words]
Description: [Star rating, customer count, or guarantee]
CTA button: [Get Started / Try Free / Shop Now]
```

**Hook Type 3 — Direct Offer:**
```
Primary text:
[Bold claim or stat that grabs attention]

[1-2 sentences explaining the offer]

What's included:
→ [Item/benefit 1]
→ [Item/benefit 2]
→ [Item/benefit 3]

[Urgency: Limited time / spots / bonus]

[CTA: Get yours before [deadline]]

Headline: [Offer + urgency, 5-8 words]
Description: [Price, discount, or guarantee]
CTA button: [Get Offer / Claim Discount / Buy Now]
```

**Ad copy rules:**
- Primary text: 125 characters visible before "See more" — front-load the hook
- Headline: 40 characters max for full display
- Description: 25 characters max on mobile
- Use line breaks for readability (no walls of text)
- Emojis: 1-2 max, only if audience-appropriate

### Step 5: Creative Direction

**Image ads (1080x1080 or 1080x1350):**
- Style: UGC (user-generated content) feel outperforms polished studio
- Text overlay: Keep under 20% of image area
- Include: Product in use, face showing emotion, before/after, or bold text overlay
- Avoid: Cluttered backgrounds, tiny text, stock photo look

**Video ads (9:16 for Reels/Stories, 1:1 for Feed):**
- Hook: First 3 seconds must stop the scroll (movement, text, question)
- Length: 15-30 seconds for cold traffic, 30-60 seconds for retargeting
- Structure: Hook → Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA
- Captions: Always add — 85% of videos are watched without sound
- Thumbnail: Custom frame that works as a static image

**Creative testing matrix:**

| Test | Variable | Hold Constant |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Test 1 | 3 different hooks (first 3 sec) | Same body, same audience |
| Test 2 | Image vs. Video vs. Carousel | Same copy, same audience |
| Test 3 | UGC vs. polished creative | Same copy, same audience |

### Step 6: Budget Allocation & Bidding

**Budget framework:**

| Phase | Duration | Daily Budget/Ad Set | Goal |
|-------|----------|-------------------|------|
| Testing | 3-7 days | $20-50 | Find winning ad + audience combos |
| Validation | 7-14 days | $50-100 | Confirm CPA is sustainable |
| Scaling | Ongoing | 20% increase every 3-4 days | Increase volume while holding CPA |

**Bidding strategy:**
- Start with: Lowest cost (automatic bidding)
- Switch to: Cost cap once you know your target CPA
- Set cost cap at: 1.2x your target CPA (gives algorithm room)
- Never: Set bid cap too low — the algorithm won't spend and won't learn

**Scaling rules:**
- Horizontal scaling: Duplicate winning ad set to new audiences
- Vertical scaling: Increase budget 20% every 3-4 days (never more than 20%)
- Kill rule: If CPA exceeds 2x target for 3+ days, pause and diagnose

### Step 7: A/B Testing Protocol

**Test priority order:**
1. **Audiences** (biggest impact) — Test 3+ audiences first
2. **Creative format** (image vs. video vs. carousel)
3. **Hook/headline** (first thing people see)
4. **Body copy** (supporting message)
5. **CTA** (button text and offer framing)

**Testing rules:**
- Change ONE variable at a time
- Minimum budget: $20/day per variation
- Minimum duration: 3-7 days (or 50+ conversion events)
- Winner threshold: 20%+ better CPA with statistical significance
- Use Meta's built-in A/B test tool for clean attribution

**Testing log template:**

| Test # | Variable | Variation A | Variation B | Winner | CPA Difference |
|--------|----------|------------|------------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Audience | Interest stack | 1% Lookalike | | |
| 2 | Creative | UGC video | Product image | | |
| 3 | Hook | Problem Q | Bold stat | | |
