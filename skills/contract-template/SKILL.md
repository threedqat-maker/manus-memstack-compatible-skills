# Contract Template — Drafting service agreement...
*Provides service agreement, NDA, and subcontractor templates with scope, payment, IP ownership, confidentiality, termination, and liability clauses.*

## Scope Guard

Use this section to decide whether this skill is appropriate for the current task. **ACTIVE** means the skill is relevant; **DORMANT** means another skill or a general response is likely better.

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "contract", "agreement", "service agreement", "NDA" | ACTIVE |
| User says "freelance contract" or "consulting agreement" | ACTIVE |
| User needs a written agreement for client or vendor work | ACTIVE |
| User wants an invoice | DORMANT — use Invoice Generator |
| User wants a project proposal | DORMANT — use Proposal Writer |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Handshake deal, no contract" | Verbal agreements are unenforceable. A simple contract protects both parties. |
| "Skip IP ownership clause" | Without explicit IP transfer, the creator often retains rights by default. Always specify. |
| "No termination clause" | Without exit terms, either party is trapped. Define how and when the contract can end. |
| "Copy a template without reading" | Every clause should match your actual arrangement. Mismatched terms create liability. |
| "No dispute resolution" | Without a specified method (mediation, arbitration, jurisdiction), disputes escalate to costly litigation. |

**Disclaimer:** These templates are starting points, not legal advice. Have an attorney review contracts before use, especially for high-value engagements.

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Contract Requirements

If the user hasn't provided details, ask:

> 1. **Contract type** — service agreement, NDA, subcontractor agreement, or other?
> 2. **Parties** — who is the provider and who is the client?
> 3. **Scope** — what work is being performed?
> 4. **Payment** — flat fee, hourly, retainer, milestone-based?
> 5. **Duration** — start date, end date, or ongoing?
> 6. **Special terms** — non-compete, exclusivity, IP considerations?

### Step 2: Select Contract Type

| Type | Use When | Key Clauses |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Service Agreement** | Providing professional services to a client | Scope, payment, IP, liability, termination |
| **NDA (Mutual)** | Both parties share confidential information | Definition of confidential info, exclusions, duration, remedies |
| **NDA (One-way)** | Only one party shares confidential info | Same as mutual but obligations on one side |
| **Subcontractor Agreement** | Hiring someone to help deliver client work | Scope, payment, IP assignment, confidentiality, non-solicitation |
| **Retainer Agreement** | Ongoing monthly services at a fixed rate | Hours/month, rollover policy, scope boundaries, renewal |
