#  Dependency Audit — Supply Chain Security Scanner
*Scan project dependencies for vulnerabilities, outdated packages, abandoned libraries, and supply chain risks with a prioritized upgrade plan.*

## Protocol

### Step 1: Detect Project Type

Identify the package ecosystem from project files:

| File Found | Ecosystem | Audit Command | Outdated Command |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `package.json` | npm/Node.js | `npm audit --json` | `npm outdated --json` |
| `package-lock.json` | npm (locked) | `npm audit --json` | `npm outdated --json` |
| `yarn.lock` | Yarn | `yarn audit --json` | `yarn outdated --json` |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm | `pnpm audit --json` | `pnpm outdated --json` |
| `requirements.txt` | pip/Python | `pip audit --format=json` | `pip list --outdated --format=json` |
| `Pipfile.lock` | Pipenv | `pipenv check --output json` | `pipenv update --dry-run` |
| `pyproject.toml` | Poetry/Python | `pip audit --format=json` | `poetry show --outdated` |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust/Cargo | `cargo audit --json` | `cargo outdated --format json` |
| `go.mod` | Go | `govulncheck ./...` | `go list -u -m all` |
| `Gemfile.lock` | Ruby/Bundler | `bundle audit check --format json` | `bundle outdated` |

If multiple ecosystems detected, audit all of them. Report which ecosystem each finding belongs to.

### Step 2: Run Vulnerability Scan

Execute the appropriate audit command and parse results into a unified format:

```
── VULNERABILITY SCAN ─────────────────────

CVE-2024-XXXXX   CRITICAL
  Package: [name]@[version]
  Dependency: Direct / Transitive (via [parent])
  Fixed in: [version]
  Description: [brief description]
  CVSS Score: [score]
  Exploitability: [network/local] [complexity]

CVE-2024-YYYYY   HIGH
  Package: [name]@[version]
  Dependency: Transitive (via [parent] → [grandparent])
  Fixed in: [version]
  Description: [brief description]
  CVSS Score: [score]
  Exploitability: [network/local] [complexity]
```

**Severity classification:**

| Severity | CVSS Score | Icon | Action |
|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 |  | Fix immediately — potential active exploitation |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 |  | Fix within 1 week — significant risk |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |  | Fix within 1 month — moderate risk |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 |  | Fix when convenient — minimal risk |

**Direct vs transitive priority:**
- **Direct dependency**: You explicitly installed it — highest priority, easiest to fix
- **Transitive dependency**: Pulled in by another package — fix by updating the direct parent
- If the transitive parent hasn't released a fix, consider overriding with `overrides` (npm) or `resolutions` (Yarn)

### Step 3: Check for Outdated Packages

Run the outdated command and categorize results:

```
── OUTDATED PACKAGES ──────────────────────

Package          Current    Latest     Type      Risk
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[package-a]      1.2.3      1.2.8      Patch      Safe — bug fixes only
[package-b]      2.1.0      2.4.0      Minor      Safe — new features, backward compatible
[package-c]      3.0.0      4.2.1      Major     ️ Breaking — review changelog
[package-d]      1.0.0      1.0.0      Current    Up to date
```

**Version gap classification:**

| Gap Type | Risk | Approach |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Patch** (1.2.3 → 1.2.8) | Very Low | Update immediately — bug/security fixes |
| **Minor** (2.1.0 → 2.4.0) | Low | Update in batch — new features, backward compatible |
| **Major** (3.0.0 → 4.2.1) | Medium-High | Review migration guide, test thoroughly |
| **Multiple majors** (1.x → 4.x) | High | Dedicate time, may require code changes |

### Step 4: Identify Abandoned Packages

Check each dependency for maintenance status:

```
── ABANDONED PACKAGE CHECK ────────────────

Package          Last Publish    Downloads/wk    Status
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[package-x]      3 years ago     12,000          ️ ABANDONED — find alternative
[package-y]      2.5 years ago   800              DEAD — replace immediately
[package-z]      6 months ago    250,000          Active
```

**Abandonment indicators:**
- No npm/PyPI publish in 2+ years
- No GitHub commits in 1+ year
- Open issues/PRs with no maintainer response for 6+ months
- Maintainer has publicly archived the repository
- Deprecation notice in README or package metadata

**For each abandoned package, suggest:**
- Alternative package (actively maintained fork or replacement)
- Migration effort estimate (drop-in replacement vs API changes)
- Risk of staying: known unpatched vulnerabilities, compatibility drift

### Step 5: Supply Chain Risk Assessment

Check for packages with known supply chain risk factors:

| Risk Factor | Detection Method | Severity |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Typosquatting** | Package name similar to popular package | High |
| **Install scripts** | `preinstall`/`postinstall` scripts in package.json | Medium |
| **Excessive permissions** | Package requests network/fs access unexpectedly | Medium |
| **Single maintainer** | One person controls publishing | Low-Medium |
| **Recent ownership transfer** | npm ownership changed recently | High |
| **Minified source only** | No readable source code in package | Medium |
| **Unpinned dependencies** | Using `*` or `>=` in dependency ranges | Medium |

```
── SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS ─────────────────────

[package-a]  ️ Has postinstall script
  Script: "postinstall": "node setup.js"
  Review: [does it fetch remote code? write to fs? safe build step?]

[package-b]  ️ Single maintainer, low download count
  Maintainer: [username]
  Weekly downloads: [count]
  Alternative: [more established package]
```

### Step 6: Generate Upgrade Plan

Create a prioritized upgrade plan in three tiers:

```
━━━ TIER 1: IMMEDIATE (This Sprint) ━━━━━━
Critical/High vulnerabilities in direct dependencies.
Patch updates with no breaking changes.

1. [package]@[current] → [target]
   Reason:  CVE-2024-XXXXX (CRITICAL)
   Risk: None — patch update
   Command: npm install [package]@[target]

2. [package]@[current] → [target]
   Reason:  CVE-2024-YYYYY (HIGH)
   Risk: None — minor update
   Command: npm install [package]@[target]

━━━ TIER 2: PLANNED (Next 2 Weeks) ━━━━━━━
Medium vulnerabilities, minor version updates,
replacing abandoned packages.

3. [package]@[current] → [target]
   Reason:  CVE-2024-ZZZZZ (MEDIUM) + 8 minor versions behind
   Risk: Low — review changelog for deprecations
   Command: npm install [package]@[target]
   Test: [specific areas to regression test]

4. [package] → [replacement-package]
   Reason: ️ Abandoned (last publish: 2 years ago)
   Risk: Medium — API differences, migration needed
   Migration: [brief migration steps]

━━━ TIER 3: SCHEDULED (Next Quarter) ━━━━━━
Major version upgrades requiring migration effort.

5. [package]@[current] → [target]
   Reason: 3 major versions behind, accumulating tech debt
   Risk: High — breaking changes in v3 and v4
   Migration guide: [URL]
   Estimated effort: [hours/days]
   Test: [comprehensive regression testing required]
```

### Step 7: Override Guidance

When a transitive dependency can't be fixed by updating the direct parent:

**npm (overrides in package.json):**
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "vulnerable-package": ">=2.0.1"
  }
}
```

**Yarn (resolutions in package.json):**
```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "vulnerable-package": ">=2.0.1"
  }
}
```

**pnpm (overrides in package.json):**
```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "vulnerable-package": ">=2.0.1"
    }
  }
}
```

**Pip (constraint file):**
```
# constraints.txt
vulnerable-package>=2.0.1
```
```bash
pip install -c constraints.txt -r requirements.txt
```

**Caution:** Overrides can break compatibility. Always test after applying.

### Step 8: CI Integration Recommendation

Recommend automated dependency scanning in CI:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Dependency Audit
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 9 AM
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'package.json'
      - 'package-lock.json'

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm audit --audit-level=high
      - run: npm outdated || true  # Don't fail on outdated
```

**Recommended tools for ongoing monitoring:**
- **Dependabot** (GitHub): Auto-creates PRs for updates
- **Renovate** (any platform): More configurable than Dependabot
- **Snyk**: Deep vulnerability scanning + fix PRs
- **Socket.dev**: Supply chain risk detection

### Step 9: Output

Present the complete dependency health report:

```
━━━ DEPENDENCY HEALTH REPORT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━
