# Competitor Analysis — Analyzing competitive landscape...
*Provides a structured 5-point competitive analysis covering pricing, features, positioning, traffic sources, and weaknesses — output as a comparison matrix with strategic recommendations.*

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User says "competitor analysis", "competitive analysis" | ACTIVE |
| User says "compare products" or "market positioning" | ACTIVE |
| User wants to understand competitive landscape before building/launching | ACTIVE |
| User wants to set their own pricing | DORMANT — use Pricing Strategy |
| User wants to write ad copy against competitors | DORMANT — use Facebook Ad or Google Ad |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "Copy the market leader" | What works at their scale and brand recognition won't work for a newcomer. Find gaps, don't clone. |
| "They do everything, we can't compete" | Incumbents have feature bloat. Pick 1-3 things and do them 10x better. |
| "Ignore indirect competitors" | Spreadsheets and manual processes are often the real competition, not just SaaS tools. |
| "Only look at features" | Positioning, pricing model, and distribution channel matter more than feature checklists. |
| "One-time analysis" | Markets shift. Re-run competitive analysis quarterly. |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Competitors

If the user hasn't provided competitors, ask:

> 1. **Your product** — what do you offer? (name, category, price point)
> 2. **Known competitors** — who do customers compare you to?
> 3. **Market** — B2B or B2C? Industry vertical? Geographic focus?

Then identify three competitor tiers:

| Tier | Definition | How Many |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Direct** | Same product category, same target market | 3-5 |
| **Indirect** | Different approach to the same problem | 2-3 |
| **Aspirational** | Market leaders you aim to compete with eventually | 1-2 |

**Research sources:**
- Their website (pricing page, features page, about page)
- G2, Capterra, Trustpilot reviews (filter by 1-3 star for weaknesses)
- Product Hunt, Reddit discussions, Twitter mentions
- SimilarWeb or SEMrush for traffic data (if available)
- Their blog, changelog, and social media for positioning signals
- Job postings (reveal strategic priorities and tech stack)

### Step 2: Pricing Comparison

Build a pricing comparison matrix:

| | Your Product | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Free tier** | Yes/No | | | |
| **Entry price** | $X/mo | | | |
| **Mid-tier price** | $X/mo | | | |
| **Enterprise price** | $X/mo or custom | | | |
| **Pricing model** | Per seat / flat / usage | | | |
| **Annual discount** | X% | | | |
| **Free trial** | X days | | | |

**Pricing analysis questions:**
- Who is the cheapest? Who is the most expensive? Where do you sit?
- What pricing model do they use? (per seat, per usage, flat rate, freemium)
- Is there a pricing gap in the market? (e.g., no good option between $0 and $99/mo)
- What's their free-to-paid conversion strategy?

### Step 3: Feature Comparison

Build a feature matrix for the top 15-20 features customers care about:

| Feature | Your Product | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C |
|---------|---|---|---|---|
| [Feature 1] | Full | Full | Partial | None |
| [Feature 2] | Full | None | Full | Full |
| [Feature 3] | Partial | Full | Full | None |
| ... | | | | |

**Feature rating scale:**
- **Full** — feature is complete and polished
- **Partial** — feature exists but limited or in beta
- **None** — feature not available
- **Superior** — best-in-class implementation

**Feature analysis questions:**
- Which features do ALL competitors have? (table stakes — you must have them)
- Which features does NO competitor have? (potential differentiator if valuable)
- Where are competitors weakest? (opportunity to excel)
- What features do customers complain about most in reviews?

### Step 4: Positioning & Messaging Analysis

For each competitor, document:

```
Competitor: [Name]
Tagline: "[Their homepage tagline]"
Target audience: [Who they're clearly targeting]
Key message: [Their primary value proposition]
Tone: [Professional / Casual / Technical / Fun]
Positioning: [Cheapest / Best / Easiest / Most Powerful / Niche-specific]

Homepage hero:
- Headline: "[Exact text]"
- Subheadline: "[Exact text]"
- CTA: "[Button text]"
- Social proof: "[What they show — logos, numbers, testimonials]"
```

**Positioning map:**

Plot competitors on a 2x2 matrix using the two most relevant axes for your market:

```
                    Premium
                      │
                      │
    Complex ──────────┼────────── Simple
                      │
                      │
                   Affordable
```

Place each competitor (and yourself) on the map. Identify the open quadrant — that's your positioning opportunity.

### Step 5: Traffic & Distribution Analysis

For each competitor, research:

| Channel | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Organic search** (estimated monthly visits) | | | |
| **Paid search** (running Google Ads?) | Y/N | | |
| **Social media** (primary platform + follower count) | | | |
| **Content marketing** (blog frequency, topics) | | | |
| **Email** (newsletter? nurture sequences?) | | | |
| **Referral/affiliate** (partner programs?) | | | |
| **Community** (Slack, Discord, forum?) | | | |
| **Product Hunt** (launched? ranking?) | | | |

**Distribution analysis questions:**
- Which channels drive the most traffic for each competitor?
- Are there underutilized channels where you can win? (e.g., YouTube, podcast)
- What content topics are they ranking for? (use SEO tools or manual search)
- What's their social media engagement rate, not just follower count?

### Step 6: Weakness & Opportunity Analysis

For each competitor, extract weaknesses from:
- **1-3 star reviews** on G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, App Store
- **Reddit/Twitter complaints** — search "[competitor] sucks" or "[competitor] alternative"
- **Churned customer feedback** — if you can find it

**Weakness categories:**

| Category | Comp A Weakness | Comp B Weakness | Comp C Weakness |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **UX/Design** | | | |
| **Performance** | | | |
| **Pricing** | | | |
| **Support** | | | |
| **Missing features** | | | |
| **Integration gaps** | | | |
| **Onboarding** | | | |

**SWOT summary per competitor:**

```
Competitor: [Name]
Strengths: [2-3 key strengths]
Weaknesses: [2-3 key weaknesses]
Opportunities: [What you can exploit]
Threats: [What they might do that hurts you]
```

### Step 7: Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, provide:

**1. Positioning recommendation:**
> "Position as [positioning angle] because [reasoning based on competitive gaps]"

**2. Feature priority (build these first):**
| Priority | Feature | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| P0 | [Feature] | Table stakes — every competitor has it |
| P0 | [Feature] | Biggest competitor weakness |
| P1 | [Feature] | Differentiator — no one does this well |
| P2 | [Feature] | Nice-to-have — builds on P1 |

**3. Pricing recommendation:**
> "[Pricing strategy] at [$X/mo] because [competitive gap or positioning reason]"

**4. Channel recommendation:**
> "Focus on [2-3 channels] because [competitors are weak here / audience is underserved]"

**5. Messaging recommendation:**
> "Lead with [angle] because [no competitor owns this message]"
